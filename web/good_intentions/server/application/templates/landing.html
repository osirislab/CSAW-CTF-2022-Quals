    <h1>Welcome to the Starfinder Project!</h1>

    Thank you for showing interest in our efforts in collecting labeled images of our vast and amazing universe!</br>
</br>
    The Starfinder Project is dedicated to becoming a repository of labeled space images to assist machine learning models identify objects in space.</br>
</br>
    We are currently mid-development for our image collection website. As you can see it's not much of a looker quite yet, but we were too excited to get started!</br>
</br>
    For now you can help the project by uploading your labeled images via our published API!</br></br>
