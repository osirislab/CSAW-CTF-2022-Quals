## Files

Please use the inputs.zip file to access the training and testing samples for your model.
There are various ways to solve this challenge, but you will ultimately need a image classification model to do so.

## Submission

Once complete, export you model in h1 or h5 format for testing (You should aim for a >=90% accuracy to sufficiently pass).

# Hint:

Convolutional Neural Nets are a classic method used for image classification.
