# Quantum Leap

This challenge is an introduction to the Controlled NOT (C-NOT or CNOT) quantum logic gate. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_Gate).

The flags original bits were put into the CNOT gate in order and operated on. The output is a random string and can be reversed by placing the random string back through the CNOT gate.
