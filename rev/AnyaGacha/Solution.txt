There are two solutions:



Binary solution:

The number of coin is encrypted in memory, however stored locally. 
If you can decrypt it and locate the value in the memory, 
you can change the value and make 1000 lucky draws for the guaranteed Anya
you can click the button by hand or make a program to do it :)


Web+Crypto solution:

Use Wireshark or other network monitors to capture the packet sent by the client when making a draw
decode all the base64 and you'll find that for any packet:
the sha256 of the value in the previous packet is the value of the current packet 
it is actually a hash counter
get the first value and do sha256 999 times, 
encoded that value with b64 then send it to the server to get the flag :)
