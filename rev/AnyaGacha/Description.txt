We setup the server and the players downloaded the game software. 
(Right now I only uploaded Windows version for test, 
there will be MacOS and Linux support)

It is a Gacha game where the player spend coins to do lucky draw.
If they can get the rare character Anya, she will tell the player our flag!



##For Local test

the server code is in src/server
the builded client is in build_localtest_win/ 

The server address in the client executable is "localhost:8081" for testing

1. Run Nodejs server
2. Open the client (it is necessary to downloaded everything in the folder, not just that .exe file)
